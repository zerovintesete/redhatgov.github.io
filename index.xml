      <description>Future Work One of the goals of this example workshop is to showcase all of the things that are possible when building a workshop. Initially, some work needs to be done to highlight what&#39;s already available. It&#39;s also expected that additional features will be added over time.
This &amp;quot;lab&amp;quot; is a place to collect those ideas so that we don&#39;t forget to update this workshop as we have time.</description>

      <description>Install Docker Install Docker $ sudo -i # yum install -y docker   Start Docker To start the docker binary and have it managed by systemd we first need to enable it and tell systemd that we want it to run a boot time. Then to start the docker daemon right away we use the start command.
 systemctl enable docker   systemctl start docker   systemctl status docker   Once docker starts successfully you should see a similar output as below.</description>

      <description>Cockpit A remote manager for GNU/Linux servers
 Cockpit is a server manager that makes it easy to administer your GNU/Linux servers via a web browser.
 Cockpit makes it easy for any sysadmin to perform simple tasks, such as administering storage, inspecting journals and starting and stopping services.
 Jumping between the terminal and the web tool is no problem. A service started via Cockpit can be stopped via the terminal.</description>

      <description>Before we get into OpenShift lets explore what Linux Kernel Capabilities are and some of the steps that OpenShift has taken to remove certain capabilities by default.
   What are Linux Capabilities? According to the capabilities man page;
 Capabilities are distinct units of privilege that can be independently enabled or disabled.
 Capabilities were added to the kernel around 15 or so years ago to try to divide up the power of root.</description>

      <title>Exercise 1.0 - Running Ad-hoc commands</title>

      <guid>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/ansible_tower/exercise1.0/</guid>
      <description>Section 1: Ad-hoc commands For our first exercise, we are going to run some ad-hoc commands to help you get a feel for how Ansible works. Ansible Ad-Hoc commands enable you to perform tasks on remote nodes without having to write a playbook. They are very useful when you simply need to do one or two things quickly and often, to many remote nodes.
 Step 0: Define your inventory. Inventories are crucial to Ansible as they define remote machines on which you wish to run commands or your playbook(s).</description>

      <guid>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/cloudforms41/exercise1.1/</guid>
      <description>What&#39;s An Infrastructure Provider? In Red Hat CloudForms, an infrastructure provider is a virtual infrastructure environment that you can add to a Red Hat CloudForms appliance to manage and interact with the resources in that environment.
In other words, a infrastructure provider is a management platform for managing virtual machines from a single type of hypervisor. Infrastructure providers supported by CloudForms are Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Management (RHEV-M), VMware vCenter and Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM).</description>

      <title>Exercise 1.1 - Pulling Docker Images</title>
      <link>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/containers_101/exercise1.1/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/containers_101/exercise1.1/</guid>
      <description>Pull Images Docker pull command docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/rhel   An image is identified by a repository name (registry.access.redhat.com), a namespace name (rhel7) and the image name (rhel). You could also add a tag (which defaults to :latest if not entered). The repository name rhel, when passed to the docker pull command without the name of a registry preceding it, is ambiguous and could result in the retrieval of an image that originates from an untrusted registry.</description>

      <title>Exercise 1.1 - Reproducible and Trustworthy Dockerfiles</title>
      <link>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/security_containers/exercise1.1/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/security_containers/exercise1.1/</guid>
      <description>Now that you&amp;#8217;ve gotten a sense of how Cockpit works, we are going to start digging in at the commandline on Container security. You can use either the Terminal in Cockpit from your browser, a SSH terminal or Terminal client like PuTTy. The choice is yours.
   Best Practices Step 1: Always specify a tag in FROM instructions. FROM redis is bad, because it pulls the latest tag, which changes over time and can be expected to move with major version changes.</description>

      <title>Exercise 1.1 - SELinux</title>
      <link>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/security_openshift/exercise1.1/</link>

      <guid>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/security_openshift/exercise1.1/</guid>
      <description>SELinux is primarily a labeling system that assigns a label (name) to every process and system object. This allows every aspect of kernel operations to be first labeled, second classified, and then ultimately enforced by a set of rules that the provider maintains.
 BENEFITS OF RUNNING SELINUX
   All processes and files are labeled with a type. A type defines a domain for processes, and a type for files.</description>

      <description>Now that you&amp;#8217;ve gotten a sense of how ansible works, we are going to write our first ansible playbook. The playbook is where you can take some of those ad-hoc commands you just ran and put them into a repeatable set of plays and tasks.
 A playbook can have multiple plays and a play can have one or multiple tasks. The goal of a play is to map a group of hosts.</description>

      <description>Let’s jump right in and start writing our first automation script. In time-honored fashion we’ll write “Hello, World!” to the Automate Engine logfile.
Before we do anything, we need to ensure that the Automation Engine server role is selected on our CloudForms appliance. We do this from the Configure → Configuration menu, selecting the CloudForms server in the Settings accordion.
 The Automation Engine server role is now enabled by default in CloudForms 4.</description>

      <description>What&#39;s An Infrastructure Host? In Red Hat CloudForms, hosts are hypervisors running on physical hardware providing virtual machines and infrastructure.
The CloudForms Management Engine automatically adds hosts from discovered providers. However, you can also discover hosts directly if not using a provider. Discovering hosts is only supported for standalone VMware vSphere servers.
Explore Infrastructure Hosts  Select Compute → Infrastructure → Hosts.

      <description>Now that you&amp;#8217;ve gotten a sense of software provenance in Dockerfiles lets take a look at the USER in Dockerfiles.
 By default docker containers run as root. A docker container running as root has full control of the host system. As docker matures, more secure default options may become available. For now, requiring root is dangerous for others and may not be available in all environments. Your image should use the USER instruction to specify a non-root user for containers to run as.</description>

      <description>Run Docker When you execute a docker run command, you essentially spin up and create a new container from a Docker image. That container consists of the contents of the image, plus features based on any additional options you pass on the docker run command line.
 The command you pass on the docker run command line sees the inside the container as its running environment so, by default, very little can be seen of the host system.</description>

 Ansible exists to make tasks simple and repeatable. We also know that not all systems are exactly alike and often require some slight change to the way an Ansible playbook is run. Enter variables.
 Variables are how we deal with differences between your systems, allowing you to account for a change in port, IP address or directory.</description>

      <description>Skopeo is a command line utility for various operations on container images and image repositories.
 Skopeo is able to inspect a repository on a Docker registry and fetch images layers. By inspect I mean it fetches the repository&amp;#8217;s manifest and it is able to show you a docker inspect-like json output about a whole repository or a tag.
 This tool, in contrast to docker inspect, helps you gather useful information about a repository or a tag before pulling it (using disk space) - e.</description>

      <description>What&#39;s Infrastructure Provisioning? In Red Hat CloudForms, when a virtual machine or cloud instance is provisioned, it goes through multiple phases. First, the request must be made. The request includes ownership information, tags, virtual hardware requirements, the operating system, and any customization of the request. Second, the request must go through an approval phase, either automatic or manual. Finally, the request is executed.
Execution consists of pre-processing and post-processing. Pre-processing acquires IP addresses for the user, creates VMDB instances, and creates the virtual machine based on information in the request.</description>

  While public registries and uncurated repositories are acceptable for some cloud-native development and proof-of-concept projects, they do not always provide content that is fit for production consumption; enterprise workloads require enterprise-ready tools.   MATTHEW HICKSVICE PRESIDENT, ENGINEERING, OPENSHIFT AND MANAGEMENT, RED HAT
 While container-based applications have begun moving into production, not all containers are created or maintained equally. Every container starts with a Linux base layer, which means that every ISV building container images is distributing Linux content.</description>

      <description>Seccomp Secure Computing Mode (seccomp) is a kernel feature that allows you to filter system calls to the kernel from a container. The combination of restricted and allowed calls are arranged in profiles, and you can pass different profiles to different containers. Seccomp provides more fine-grained control than capabilities, giving an attacker a limited number of syscalls from the container.

 Capabilities are distinct units of privilege that can be independently enabled or disabled.
 Capabilities were added to the kernel around 15 or so years ago to try to divide up the power of root. Originally the kernel allocated a 32-bit bitmask to define these capabilities. A few years ago it was expanded to 64. There are currently around 38 capabilities defined.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses Markdown for its simple content format. However, there are a lot of things that Markdown doesn’t support well.
We are unwilling to accept being constrained by our simple format. Also unacceptable is writing raw HTML in our Markdown every time we want to include unsupported content such as a video. To do so is in complete opposition to the intent of using a bare-bones format for our content and utilizing templates to apply styling for display.</description>

      <description>Microservice Integration Patterns  In previous labs, we created two new microservices with the intention of replacing functionality (“strangling”) the monolithic application. Currently no traffic is routed to them. If you were to re-route traffic from the monolith’s /services/products API to the new catalog service’s /services/catalog endpoint, you would be missing the inventory data. In this lab we will consider different options and architectures for integrating the microservices’ functionality into our app.</description>

      <description>Strangling the Monolith Design Pattern  Strangling - incrementally replacing functionality in app with something better (cheaper, faster, easier to maintain). As functionality is replaced, “dead” parts of monolith can be removed/retired. You can also wait for all functionality to be replaced before retiring anything! You can optionally include new functionality during strangulation to make it more attractive to business stakeholders.   https://paulhammant.com/2013/07/14/legacy-application-strangulation-case-studies/

S2I is a framework that makes it easy to turn your source code into runnable images. The main advantage of using S2I for building reproducible docker images is the ease of use for developers. You&#39;ll see just how simple it can be in this lab.
Let&#39;s build a node.js web server using S2I We can do this either via the command line or the web console.</description>

      <description>Floating IP vs. Private IP Addresses Private IP Address A private IP address is assigned to an instance&#39;s network-interface by the DHCP server. The address is visible from within the instance by using a command like “ip a”. The address is typically part of a private network and is used for communication between instances in the same broadcast domain via virtual switch (L2 agent on each compute node). It can also be accessible from instances in other private networks via virtual router (L3 agent).</description>

      <description>Developing and managing an application in OpenShift In this lab we will explore some of the common activities undertaken by developers working in OpenShift. You will become familiar with how to use environment variables, secrets, build configurations, and more. Let&#39;s look at some of the basic things a developer might care about for a deployed app.
Setup From the previous lab you should have the DC Metro Maps web app running in OpenShift.</description>

      <description>Security Groups in OpenStack A security group is a named collection of network access rules that are used to limit the types of traffic that have access to instances. When you launch an instance, you can assign one or more security groups to it. If you do not create security groups, new instances are automatically assigned to the default security group, unless you explicitly specify a different security group.</description>

      <description>Where Shall We Store Our Golden Images? Glance The Image service (glance) project provides a service where users can upload and discover data assets that are meant to be used with other services. This currently includes images and metadata definitions.
Glance image services include discovering, registering, and retrieving virtual machine (VM) images. Glance has a RESTful API that allows querying of VM image metadata as well as retrieval of the actual image.</description>

      <description>Build Triggers, Webhooks and Rollbacks - Oh My! Once you have an app deployed in OpenShift you can take advantage of some continuous capabilities that help to enable DevOps and automate your management process. We will cover some of those in this lab: Build triggers, webhooks, and rollbacks.
A bit of configuration We are going to do some integration and coding with an external git repository. For this lab we are going to use github, if you don&#39;t already have an account, you can create one here.</description>

      <description>Now We are Ready to Launch an OpenStack Instance First, What is an Instance? Instances are virtual machines that run inside the OpenStack cloud. You can launch an instance from the following sources:
 Images uploaded to the Image service
 Image that you have copied to a persistent volume. The instance launches from the volume, which is provided by the cinder-volume API through iSCSI
 Instance snapshot that you took  Let&#39;s Go Launch a New Instance  Navigate to Compute -&amp;gt; Instances using the second level navigation tabs</description>

      <description>Things will go wrong, and that&#39;s why we have replication and recovery Things will go wrong with your software, or your hardware, or from something out of your control. But we can plan for that failure, and planning for it let&#39;s us minimize the impact. OpenShift supports this via what we call replication and recovery.
Replication Let&#39;s walk through a simple example of how the replication controller can keep your deployment at a desired state.</description>

      <guid>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/openshift_101_dcmetromap/lab7-labels/</guid>
      <description>Labels This is a pretty simple lab, we are going to explore labels. You can use labels to organize, group, or select API objects.
For example, pods are &amp;quot;tagged&amp;quot; with labels, and then services use label selectors to identify the pods they proxy to. This makes it possible for services to reference groups of pods, even treating pods with potentially different docker containers as related entities.
Labels on a pod In a previous lab we added our web app using a S2I template.</description>

      <description>Okay. UIs Are Cool and All, But Can&#39;t I Just Use the CLI? Absolutely! There are 3 ways to interact with OpenStack.
 APIs
 CLIs
 Horizon  In this lab, we are going to walk through some of the activities that we did in the previous labs via the CLIs.
 When you see a CLI command starting with openstack, the command is part of the Unified CLI.</description>

      <description>CI/CD Defined In modern software projects many teams utilize the concept of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). By setting up a tool chain that continuously builds, tests, and stages software releases a team can ensure that their product can be reliably released at any time. OpenShift can be an enabler in the creation and management of this tool chain.
In this lab we walk through creating a simple example of a CI/CD pipeline utlizing Jenkins, all running on top of OpenShift!</description>

      <description>We Have Done a Ton of Stuff, But All Manually. How Do We Orchestrate? In OpenStack, the answer to that is Heat.
Heat is the main project in the OpenStack Orchestration program. It implements an orchestration engine to launch multiple composite cloud applications based on templates in the form of text files that can be treated like code. A native Heat template format is evolving, but Heat also endeavours to provide compatibility with the AWS CloudFormation template format, so that many existing CloudFormation templates can be launched on OpenStack.</description>

      <guid>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/openshift_101_dcmetromap/lab9-bluegreen/</guid>
      <description>Blue/Green deployments When implementing continuous delivery for your software one very useful technique is called Blue/Green deployments. It addresses the desire to minimize downtime during the release of a new version of an application to production. Essentially, it involves running two production versions of your app side-by-side and then switching the routing from the last stable version to the new version once it is verified. Using OpenShift, this can be very seamless because using containers we can easily and rapidly deploy a duplicate infrastructure to support alternate versions and modify routes as a service.</description>

      <description>Working With Block and Object Storage in OpenStack Block Storage is Handled by Cinder The OpenStack Block Storage service works through the interaction of a series of daemon processes named cinder-* that reside persistently on the host machine or machines. You can run all the binaries from a single node, or spread across multiple nodes. You can also run them on the same node as other OpenStack services.
To administer the OpenStack Block Storage service, it is helpful to understand a number of concepts.</description>

      <description>Getting Started This entire site, including the workshop content, is built using a tool named Hugo. Hugo is known as a &amp;quot;static site generator&amp;quot; where the content you build is pre-compiled before being served by a web server.
The Good News The good news is that you don&#39;t have to worry about how Hugo works, how to configure it, or how everything gets deployed.
All of that is being handled for you and you can focus on the content of your workshop.</description>
