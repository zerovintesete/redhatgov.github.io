      <description>Welcome To CloudForms This lab provides a quick tour of the console to help you get familiar with the user interface along with some key terminology we will use in subsequent lab content. If you are already familiar with the basics of CloudForms you can skip this lab — after making sure you can login.
Key Terms Before sinking our teeth into Cloud Forms it is important to understand some terminology.</description>

      <description>What&#39;s An Infrastructure Provider? In Red Hat CloudForms, an infrastructure provider is a virtual infrastructure environment that you can add to a Red Hat CloudForms appliance to manage and interact with the resources in that environment.
In other words, a infrastructure provider is a management platform for managing virtual machines from a single type of hypervisor. Infrastructure providers supported by CloudForms are Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Management (RHEV-M), VMware vCenter and Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM).</description>

      <guid>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/cloudforms41/exercise1.18/</guid>
      <description>Let’s jump right in and start writing our first automation script. In time-honored fashion we’ll write “Hello, World!” to the Automate Engine logfile.
Before we do anything, we need to ensure that the Automation Engine server role is selected on our CloudForms appliance. We do this from the Configure → Configuration menu, selecting the CloudForms server in the Settings accordion.
 The Automation Engine server role is now enabled by default in CloudForms 4.</description>

      <description>What&#39;s An Infrastructure Host? In Red Hat CloudForms, hosts are hypervisors running on physical hardware providing virtual machines and infrastructure.
The CloudForms Management Engine automatically adds hosts from discovered providers. However, you can also discover hosts directly if not using a provider. Discovering hosts is only supported for standalone VMware vSphere servers.
Explore Infrastructure Hosts  Select Compute → Infrastructure → Hosts.
  List Infrastructure Hosts
A list of your private datacenter infrastructure hosts appears, such as VMware vSphere and Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization managed hosts (Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor).</description>

      <description>What Are Reports? In Red Hat CloudForms, reports have been constructed to help you view the most commonly requested and significant data. From here, you can also create reports if you have appropriate access. CloudForms Management Engine provides a large group of default reports organized into categories. Each category has its own set of subfolders.

      <guid>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/cloudforms41/exercise1.5/</guid>
      <description>What&#39;s Infrastructure Provisioning? In Red Hat CloudForms, when a virtual machine or cloud instance is provisioned, it goes through multiple phases. First, the request must be made. The request includes ownership information, tags, virtual hardware requirements, the operating system, and any customization of the request. Second, the request must go through an approval phase, either automatic or manual. Finally, the request is executed.
Execution consists of pre-processing and post-processing. Pre-processing acquires IP addresses for the user, creates VMDB instances, and creates the virtual machine based on information in the request.</description>

      <description>That&#39;s it! Hopefully, these labs provided you some idea of how to perform common tasks within the CloudForms environment. And hopefully, you have a deeper understanding of how CloudForms simplifies IT, providing unified management and operations in a hybrid environment.
As your IT infrastructure progresses from traditional virtualization toward an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) model, CloudForms evolves, protecting your investments and providing consistent user experience and functionality.
Please feel free to continue to &amp;quot;kick the tires&amp;quot; in the demo environment we&#39;ve setup and explore the web console.</description>
