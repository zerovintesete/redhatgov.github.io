      <title>Exercise 1.0 - Running Ad-hoc commands</title>

      <description>Section 1: Ad-hoc commands For our first exercise, we are going to run some ad-hoc commands to help you get a feel for how Ansible works. Ansible Ad-Hoc commands enable you to perform tasks on remote nodes without having to write a playbook. They are very useful when you simply need to do one or two things quickly and often, to many remote nodes.
 Step 0: Define your inventory. Inventories are crucial to Ansible as they define remote machines on which you wish to run commands or your playbook(s).</description>

      <title>Exercise 1.1 - Writing Your First playbook</title>
      <link>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/ansible_tower/exercise1.1/</link>

      <description>Now that you&amp;#8217;ve gotten a sense of how ansible works, we are going to write our first ansible playbook. The playbook is where you can take some of those ad-hoc commands you just ran and put them into a repeatable set of plays and tasks.
 A playbook can have multiple plays and a play can have one or multiple tasks. The goal of a play is to map a group of hosts.</description>

      <description>Section 1: Running the Playbook We are now going to run you&amp;#8217;re brand spankin&#39; new playbook on your two web nodes. To do this, you are going to use the ansible-playbook command.
 Step 1: From your playbook directory ( ~/apache_basic ), run your playbook.
 ansible-playbook --private-key=~/.ssh/*-tower -i ../hosts install_apache.yml   However, before you go ahead and run that command, lets take a few moments to understand the options.</description>

      <title>Exercise 1.3 - Using Variables, Loops, and Handlers</title>
      <link>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/ansible_tower/exercise1.3/</link>

      <description>Previous exercises showed you the basics of Ansible Core. In the next few exercises, we are going to teach some more advanced ansible skills that will add flexibility and power to your playbooks.
 Ansible exists to make tasks simple and repeatable. We also know that not all systems are exactly alike and often require some slight change to the way an Ansible playbook is run. Enter variables.
 Variables are how we deal with differences between your systems, allowing you to account for a change in port, IP address or directory.</description>

      <description>Congratulations! You just wrote a playbook that incorporates some key Ansible concepts that you use in most if not all of your future playbooks. Before you get too excited though, we should probably make sure it actually runs.
 So, lets do that now.
   Section 1 - Running your new apache playbook Step 1: Make sure you are in the right directory and create a host file.</description>

      <title>Exercise 1.5 - Roles: Making your playbooks reusable</title>
      <link>http://redhatgov.io/workshops/ansible_tower/exercise1.5/</link>

      <description>While it is possible to write a playbook in one file as we&amp;#8217;ve done throughout this workshop, eventually youâ€™ll want to reuse files and start to organize things.
 Ansible Roles is the way we do this. When you create a role, you deconstruct your playbook into parts and those parts sit in a directory structure. &#34;Wha?? You mean that seemingly useless best practice you mentioned in exercise 1.2?&#34;. Yep, that one.</description>

      <description>In this exercise, we are going to get Ansible Tower installed on your control node
   Installing Ansible Tower Step 1: Change directories to /tmp
 cd /tmp    Step 2: Download the latest Ansible Tower package
 curl -O http://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz    Step 3: Untar and unzip the package file
 tar xvfz /tmp/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz    Step 4: Change directories into the ansible tower package</description>

      <description>In this exercise, we are going to configure Tower so that we can run a playbook.
   Configuring Ansible Tower There are a number of contructs in the Ansible Tower UI that enable multi-tenancy, notifications, scheduling, etc. However, we are only going to focus on a few of the key contructs that are required for this workshop today.

      <description>A job template is a definition and set of parameters for running an Ansible job. Job templates are useful to execute the same job many times.
   Creating a Job Template Step 1: Select TEMPLATES
  Step 2: Click on ADD , and select JOB TEMPLATE
  Step 3: Complete the form using the following values
     NAME
 Apache Basic Job Template</description>

      <description>In this exercise, we are going to use Ansible Tower to run DISA STIG and NIST 800-53 evaluations of our environment. Note that the NIST 800-53 role also includes the execution of DISA STIG evaluation against targeted hosts.
 DISA STIG controls https://galaxy.ansible.com/MindPointGroup/RHEL7-STIG/
 NIST 800-53 controls https://galaxy.ansible.com/rhtps/800-53/
   Adding the DISA STIG and NIST 800-53 role to your Tower node Step 1: In your wetty window (if you closed it, see the SETUP step, in your workbook), type the following:</description>

      <description>Introduction to Wetty (Browser-based SSH) This lab provides a quick tour of the browser based SSH client Wetty. To help you get familiar with lab environment along with some key terminology we will use in subsequent lab content.
   Accessing Wetty Use this URL to access the Wetty node, just change the workshopname. Ask your instructor for the workshopname.
 https://&amp;lt;workshopname&amp;gt;.master.&amp;lt;student number&amp;gt;.redhatgov.io:8888   After logging in, you should see a shell.</description>

      <description>That wraps up what we have planned for today. We hope you&amp;#8217;ve learned something valuable
about Ansible and Ansible Tower that you can apply in your daily role.
 What do you think? How can we help you understand Ansible Tower better?
 Before you leave, check out the Resources page that is part of this guide. There you can
find a ton of links that will further your Ansible education.</description>
